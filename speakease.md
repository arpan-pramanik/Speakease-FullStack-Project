Speak Ease (Duolingo Clone)
1. Introduction
Learning a new language can be difficult without proper guidance, structured lessons, and regular practice. Many learners struggle to stay consistent because they do not have access to interactive exercises, quizzes, and progress tracking systems. Speak Ease solves this problem by providing a user-friendly language learning platform where users can learn languages step by step.
Speak Ease helps users practice vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, reading, and listening skills through interactive lessons and quizzes. It is designed to make language learning simple, engaging, and enjoyable.

2. Description
Speak Ease is a language learning platform inspired by Duolingo and built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform allows users to select a language they want to learn and complete structured lessons and exercises.
The system provides different learning modules such as vocabulary practice, sentence formation, grammar exercises, listening tasks, and quizzes. Each lesson contains multiple activities that help learners understand concepts step by step.
Users can track their learning progress, earn badges, unlock new lessons, and review completed exercises. The application also provides instant feedback for quiz answers, helping learners improve quickly.
The admin panel allows administrators to manage courses, create lessons, upload learning materials, and monitor user activity. Speak Ease creates an engaging environment for learners while giving administrators complete control over the platform.
